              <b>Introduction</b>
              <p>Intel&reg; Media Server Studio (Intel MSS) is a set of libraries, tools, header and sample code files that define cross-platform API for developing consumer
                 and professional grade media applications on Intel&reg; platforms. Providing an access to Intel&reg; Quick Sync Video, hardware accelerated codecs
                 in Intel&reg; Processor Graphics, Intel&reg; Media Server Studio allows application developer to speed up video playback, encoding, processing and media conversion.
                 Intel&reg; Media Server Studio for Windows\* helps to deliver desktop applications, such as video players, editors and video conferencing clients,
                 while Intel&reg; Media Server Studio for Embedded Linux\* enables digital security and surveillance and connected car manufacturers to deliver smart cameras
                 and infotainment or cluster display solutions. Hardware acceleration in Linux is supported by VA-API.</p>
                 <p>Video Acceleration API (VA API) is a royalty-free API as well as its implementation as free and open-source library (libVA) distributed under the MIT License.
                   The VA API interface is to be implemented by device drivers to offer end-user software, such as VLC media player or GStreamer, access to available video acceleration hardware,
                   such as PureVideo (through the libva-vdpau driver, which implements VA API in terms of VDPAU) or Unified Video Decoder. The API enables and provides access to
                   hardware-accelerated video processing, using hardware such as graphics processing units (GPU) to accelerate video encoding and decoding by offloading processing from the central processing unit (CPU).
                   The VA API specification was originally designed by Intel for its GMA (Graphics Media Accelerator) series of GPU hardware with the specific purpose of eventually replacing the XvMC standard as the default Unix multi-platform equivalent of Microsoft Windows\* DirectX Video Acceleration (DxVA) API, but today the API is no longer limited to Intel specific hardware or GPUs.
                   Other hardware and manufacturers can freely use this open standard API for hardware accelerated video processing with their own hardware without paying a royalty fee.
                 </p>
